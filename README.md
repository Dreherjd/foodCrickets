## A food blog for myself and partner to review foods and experiences in our area.
### Written using the TALL stack, and wireui as a component library
- Uses Laravel's built in user authentication
- The objective here was to build upon what I learned with "OnlyBirds" and do some extra stuff as a challenge, without using a tutorial this time.
- I used the built in "header" layout and styled it using custom colors.
